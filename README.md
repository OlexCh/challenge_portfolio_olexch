# Task 1: Software Configuration
## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?
### &emsp; Hello! My name is Oleksandr.
### &emsp; I want to become a QA Engineer because I like making products better.

<h3>&emsp;I have many years of experience in telecommunications
and financial technology sector.
During my work with clients, I realized that clients are interested in reliable product
quality. I also understand that offering a product that has not been thoroughly
tested may damage the product owner's reputation and impact sales.<br/>
Thus, It is crucial to discover the true state of a product and improve it to meet the expectations of the consumer.</h3>

<h3>&emsp; DARE IT's <a href="https://challenges.dareit.io/ua-qa/">"QA Automated Testing" project</a>
caught my attention because the training is done using the Challenge.<br/>
It is a good innovative solution that uses a lot of practice 
and teamwork to gain knowledge.
Teamwork is important because it helps to look at the problem from different perspectives.<br/> 
Automated testing skills will allow me to run more tests and get more accurate results. 
Ultimately, this will make it possible to create top grade quality products.<br/>
In addition to the unusual form of training, 
I am also delighted with the comprehensive support from the organizers, coordinators, 
and mentors of the Challenge.</h3>
<h3>&emsp;I expect to learn new skills and gain practical experience in automated QA from participating in this training program.
With the help of the program, I hope to develop in the direction of QA 
and get the opportunity to contribute as a QA specialist in a new place of work.</h3>
